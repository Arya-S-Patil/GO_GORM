# Go CRUD API with GORM and Gin

This is a CRUD API project implemented in Go using the GORM ORM library and the Gin web framework. It allows you to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. Set up your PostgreSQL database. You can use tools like pgAdmin or the PostgreSQL CLI to create a new database.

4. Configure the database connection by providing your PostgreSQL database details in the `.env` file. Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required environment variables.

5. Once the database connection details are provided in the `.env` file, the application will be able to connect to the database.

6. Run the application:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    The API server will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Routes

The following routes are available in the API:

- `GET /api/posts`: Get all posts.
- `GET /api/posts/:id`: Get a single post by ID.
- `POST /api/posts`: Create a new post.
- `PUT /api/posts/:id`: Update an existing post by ID.
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id`: Delete a post by ID.
