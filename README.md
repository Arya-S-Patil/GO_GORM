# Go CRUD API with GORM and Gin

![Go version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-v1.16-blue)

## Work in Progress

This is a work-in-progress project aimed at building a CRUD API using the GORM ORM library and the Gin web framework in Go. The project's objective is to connect to a PostgreSQL database and perform CRUD operations on it.

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
Set up PostgreSQL Database:Create a new PostgreSQL database using tools like pgAdmin or the PostgreSQL CLI.
Database Connection
Provide Database Details:Open the .env.example file and provide your PostgreSQL database details:
env
Copy code
DB_HOST=<database-host>
DB_PORT=<database-port>
DB_USER=<database-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>
DB_NAME=<database-name>
Rename Environment File:Rename the .env.example file to .env.
Run the Application:
bash
Copy code
go run main.go
The API server will start running on http://localhost:3000.
Routes
The following routes are available in the API:

GET /api/users: Get all users.
GET /api/users/:id: Get a single user by ID.
POST /api/users: Create a new user.
PUT /api/users/:id: Update an existing user by ID.
DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user by ID.
Feel free to expand on this README file as you progress with your project. You can add more details about the project structure, middleware usage, error handling, authentication, etc., as needed. Good luck with your project!
