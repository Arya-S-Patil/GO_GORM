# GO_GORM
STILL WORK IN PROGRESS (i have learned to set up both GORM and gin web frame work and make all crud APIs like the other repository  **https://github.com/Arya-S-Patil/go_crud_social** now am trying to connect database)

Sure, here's a README template for your Go CRUD API project with GORM and Gin:

# Go CRUD API with GORM and Gin

This is a CRUD API project implemented in Go using the GORM ORM library and the Gin web framework. It allows you to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. Set up your PostgreSQL database. You can use tools like pgAdmin or the PostgreSQL CLI to create a new database.

4. Configure the database connection by providing your PostgreSQL database details in the `.env` file. Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required environment variables.

5. Once the database connection details are provided in the `.env` file, the application will be able to connect to the database.

6. Run the application:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    The API server will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Routes

The following routes are available in the API:

- `GET /api/posts`: Get all posts.
- `GET /api/posts/:id`: Get a single post by ID.
- `POST /api/posts`: Create a new post.
- `PUT /api/posts/:id`: Update an existing post by ID.
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id`: Delete a post by ID.

## Databse connecting to be done(this is done by chatgpt)

Here's the updated content with proper spacing and formatting for the README:

### Import Required Packages

Import the necessary packages for GORM and the database driver in your Go application:

```go
import (
    "gorm.io/driver/postgres"  // For PostgreSQL
    "gorm.io/gorm"
)
```

Replace `driver/postgres` with the appropriate driver package if you're using a different database.

### Set Up Database Connection

Initialize a GORM `DB` object by opening a connection to your database. Here's an example of setting up a connection to a PostgreSQL database:

```go
func SetupDatabase() (*gorm.DB, error) {
    dsn := "host=localhost user=myuser password=mypassword dbname=mydb port=5432 sslmode=disable"
    db, err := gorm.Open(postgres.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return db, nil
}
```

Replace the connection details (`host`, `user`, `password`, `dbname`, `port`) with your actual database connection information.

### Use Database Connection

Once the database connection is set up, you can use the `db` object to perform database operations such as querying, creating, updating, and deleting records.
